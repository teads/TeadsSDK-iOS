#### CocoaPods

If your project is managing dependencies through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/), you just need to add this pod in your `Podfile`.

It will install Teads adapter and Teads SDK.

1. Add pod named `TeadsAppLovinAdapter` in your Podfile:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
pod 'TeadsAppLovinAdapter', '~> 5.0'
```

2. Run `pod install --repo-update` to install the adapter in your project.
3. Follow the [Create a custom Network](https://support.teads.tv/support/solutions/articles/36000357700-inread-applovin-mediation#create-a-custom-network) step to finish the integration.
4. You’re done.
