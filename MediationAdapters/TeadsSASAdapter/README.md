#### CocoaPods

If your project is managing dependencies through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/), you just need to add this pod in your `Podfile`.

It will install Teads adapter and Teads SDK.

1. Add pod named `TeadsSASAdapter` in your Podfile:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
pod 'TeadsSASAdapter', '~> 5.0'
```

2. Run `pod install --repo-update` to install the adapter in your project.
3. Follow the [Define Custom Event](https://support.teads.tv/support/solutions/articles/36000314771-smart-adserver-mediation#defining_a_custom_event) step to finish the integration.
4. You’re done.
